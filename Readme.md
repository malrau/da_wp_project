This repository hosts the project for the exam of the Web Programming course of the Data Analysis degree of the University of Messina. The project requires building a web or mobile application that interacts with a database and manages users with various privileges with respect to the various functions implemented within the application.
Use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is also mandatory.
One of the project possibilities is the implementation of a web portal (or mobile application) to buy and sell products. I'll focus on this and specifically on a portal for selling and buying comic books. The data are stored in a relational database containing 5 entities (the actual comic book sold, the series to which it belongs, the editor that publishes it and the authors (writer and artist) and 3 relationships connecting them.
