This repository hosts the project for the exam of the Web Programming course of the Data Analysis degree of the University of Messina. The project requires building a web or mobile application that interacts with a database and manages users with various privileges with respect to the various functions implemented within the application.
Use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is also mandatory.
So far, I have not chosen the kind of application to develop from the list suggested by the teacher.
